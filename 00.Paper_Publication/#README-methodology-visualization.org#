* 1.Existing open-source protein visualization software that was reviewed
PyMOL, BioBlender, Mage/KineMage, RasMol, Jmol, QuteMol

* 2.Why choose openFrameworks over these visualization solutions?
The aforementioned software solutions were built to serve a scientific rather than an artistic purpose. They are attuned to exporting either still images or keyframe animated videos; therefore, they lack the ability for an algorithmic, real-time manipulation of the protein that was sought after.

OpenFrameworks was chosen as a tool that would allow the performance/installation to be in perfect audio-visual sync, externally controlled (orientation or pressure sensors and sliders) and to provide stimulus via external means (haptic feedback through vibration motors).
